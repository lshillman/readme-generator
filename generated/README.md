# README Generator

  This is a little node app that asks you some questions about your project, and then spits out a super profesh README.md for you to use in your repo. It includes sections for description, installation, usage, contribution guidelines, tests, and contact information. If you select a license for your project, the README will include a section linking to the license, as well as a sweet badge (courtesy of shields.io, with the exception of CC0, which comes from licensebuttons.net) at the top of your file, right under the title. NOTE: The file you're reading right now was generated with the app :)
  
  ## Installation
  
  If you've installed Node and NPM, just clone the repo down, cd into the directory, and run npm install.
  
  ## Usage
  
  Run 'node index.js' from your terminal and you'll be off to the races. The generated README file will be saved to the 'generated' directory.
  
  ## Contributing
  
  You're welcome to send me a PR if you improve this in some way.
  
  ## Tests
  
  Unit tests coming soon! The main things to test manually are 1) how the license badge and section behave if you don't select a license, and 2) whether the README file is saved successfully.
  
  ## License
This project uses [Hippocratic 3.0](https://firstdonoharm.dev).
