## License
This project uses the [Hippocratic License, v3.0](https://firstdonoharm.dev). One of the best things to come from this project was my discovery of this license, which will be my default going forward. I love the idea of FOSS, but I think it's pretty hard these days—the Year of Our Lord MMXXII, at the time of this writing—to keep telling yourself that technology is neutral. This license essentially says "you can treat this code as open source, as long as you're not evil." The license specifically disallows use by entities that violate human rights, are extractive industries, cause harm to the environment, or are military. It gets more specific than that, but you get the gist. I also include the optional copyleft clause.
